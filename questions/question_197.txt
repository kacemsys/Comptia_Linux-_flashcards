users ask the junior Linux administrator to configure their workstations to access the payroll
server at 192.168.204.11 by the name ""Payroll"". Which of the following commands should the
administrator issue to meet this request?
A. echo ""nameserver 192.168.204.11 #Payroll"" >> /etc/resolv.conf
B. echo ""net.ipv4.ip_dynaddr=192.168.204.11 Payroll"" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
C. echo ""192.168.204.11 Payroll"" >> /etc/hosts
D. echo `IPADDR=""192.168.204.11"" #Payroll' >> /etc/network/interface
