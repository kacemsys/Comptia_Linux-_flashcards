A network administrator installed a web server on a Linux host and added a firevalid command to
open port tcp/80. The web server worked without error until an updated and patch kernel was
installed on the system a month later. Now users are unable to access the web server even
though the service is running, which of the following would fix the issue?
A. Use the firevalid command to open the HTTP application service rather than the port.
B. Change the firevalid zone t private and open port tcp/80.
C. Issue an additional firevalid command to open up port tcp/443 as well as port tcp/80.
D. Use the firevalid command to open tcp/80 both with and without the -permanent switch.
