A systems administrator is receiving errors while trying to install a popular virtualization software.
The software specifications state the processor needs to support virtualization with Intel
instructions. Additional requirements state the processor must accelerate encryption/decryption
and use hyperthreading. Given the following output about the processor:
fpu ume depse tsu msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pae mca cmov pat pse36
cflusm mmx fxsr sse sse2 ht syscall nx rdtscp lm constant_tsc rep_good
nopl xtopology nonstop_tsc pni pclmulqdq ssse3 cx16 pcid sse4_1 sse4_2
x2apic popcnt aes xsave avx rdrand hypervisor lahf_lm fsgsbase
Which of the following is the MOST likely reason for the errors?
A. The processor supports AMD instructions rather than Intel.
B. The processor cannot accelerate decryption.
C. The processor does not support hyperthreading.
D. The processor is running inside a virtual machine.
