Ann, a Linux administrator, wants to edit a configuration management file. When she opens the
file to edit, her text editor reports that the file has been opened in read-only mode. She then tries
to edit the file as root by elevating via sudo and is still unable to save any changes. The error
message in her text editor says that the read-only option is set on the file. Ann checks the
permissions on the file and sees the following:
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root wheel 30 Jun 13 15:38 infrastructure.yml
Which of the following commands is the BEST option to allow her to successfully modify the file?
A. chmod 600 infrastructure.yml
B. chown root: infrastructure.yml
C. chattr -i infrastructure.yml
D. chmod o+w infrastructure.yml
