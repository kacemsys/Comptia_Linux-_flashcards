A customer reports a Linux production server is randomly suffering degraded performance. The
administrator verifies that the sysstat package is installed and enabled on the server.
Which of the following would BEST determine what is causing the impact on performance?
A. Create a cron job that runs uptime every 15 minutes to collect historical data of the load
average of the system.
B. Leave a ping running overnight from a laptop to the server to catch any latency encountered.
C. Analyze the data in /var/log/sa using the sar command.
D. Open a screen session and run top inside of it. Let it run over night and collect the data.
