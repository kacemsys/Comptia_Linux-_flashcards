A Linux administrator is setting up a testing environment and needs to connect to a separate
testing server using the production server name. The administrator needs to override the
hostname that the DNS is returning in order to use the test environment. Which of the following
commands should be run on each of the testing systems to BEST meet this goal?
A. # hostnamectl set-hostname “192.168.1.100 production.company.com”
B. # grep –i IP “${ip addr show} production.company.com” > /etc/resolv.conf
C. # ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0 && rndc reload
production.company.com
D. # echo “192.168.1.100 production.company.com” >> /etc/hosts
