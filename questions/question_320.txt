A security team informs the Linux administrator that a specific server is acting as an open relay.
To which of the following is the security team referring?
A. The server is running the SSH service and is open to the Internet, allowing outside sources to log
into the server without source IP address filtering.
B. The server is acting as an unmanaged router, open to the Internet, and is allowing outside
Internet traffic into the network with no filtering.
C. The server is acting as a web proxy and allowing outside unauthenticated sources to connect to
the server, effectively hiding the sourceâ€™s IP address for malicious activities.
D. The server has an email service configured to allow outside sources to send email to other
external parties on the Internet without validation.
