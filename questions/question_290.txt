A Linux administrator is checking connectivity between two servers in separate subnets:
Server A: 10.1.2.20 (source)
Server B: 10.2.1.10 (destination on port 8080)
The administrator tried to run the curl 10.2.1.10:8080 command on server A and received
the following output:
curl: (7) Failed to connect to 10.2.1.10 port 8080: Connection refused.
The administrator checked on server B and confirmed nothing is listening on port 8080.
Which of the following commands, when run on server B, would have allowed the administrator to
test the connection successfully?
A. tcpdump ‘tcp port 8080’
B. ss -l -p dport=8080 dst 10.2.1.10
C. nc -l -p 8080 10.2.1.10
D. nmap -v -p 8080 10.2.1.10
