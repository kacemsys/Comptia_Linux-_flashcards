A systems administrator downloads an application's source files, compiles the application, and
installs it per the application's installation instructions. When trying to run the application, the
system states:
$ occmd
bash: occmd: command not found...
Running the locate command shows it does exist in the following location:
/opt/occmd/bin/occmd
Which of the following should the administrator do to allow the command to run properly?
(Choose two.)
A. sudo ln -s /opt/occmd/bin/occmd /usr/local/bin/occmd
B. echo ""export PATH=$PATH:/opt/occmd/bin"" >> ~/.bashrc
C. mv /opt/occmd ~/ && ln -s ~/occmd/bin/occmd ./occmd
D. echo ""#!/bin/bash \n ${which occmd}"" > /usr/bin/occmd.sh
E. sudo mv /opt/occmd/bin/occmd /etc/bin/
F. cd /opt/occmd/bin && chmod +x ./occmd && restorecon -rv *
