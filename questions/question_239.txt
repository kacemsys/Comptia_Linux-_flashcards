The Apache web server was recently installed on a Debian/Ubuntu server. The web server fails
and a review of log messages on another partition reveals the installation was not completed
properly due to lack of disk space. After clearing the files, the systems administrator has
requested the installation to be performed again.
Which of the following command lines will perform this task? (Choose two.)
A. apt-get install apache2
B. apt-get --purge remove acache2
C. apt-get --reinstall install apache2
D. apt-get --reinstall apache2
