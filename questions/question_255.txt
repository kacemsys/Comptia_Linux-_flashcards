An administrator notices a website hosted on an httpd web server is not loading. Upon further
inspection, the administrator learns there are no httpd processes running. When starting the
service, the site operates correctly for a few minutes before the process disappears again.
Which of the following should the administrator consider as the MOST likely possibility before
troubleshooting the issue?
A. The CPU has too much load, causing it to overheat, and the kernel is automatically killing the processes to keep the CPU cool.
B. An external database to which the web server connects is offline, causing httpd to die due to
execution errors.
C. Shared libraries, which were recently updated, are causing compatibility issues and httpd to die
due to version mismatch.
D. The out-of-memory killer was activated due to low available memory, causing the kernel to kill the
processes automatically.
E. The server is intermittently losing access to the network, causing socket errors that trigger httpd
to die.
