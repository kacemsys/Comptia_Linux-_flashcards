A system ran out of storage space on a particular mount and will not allow anything to be written
to disk. The df command shows there are 6GB free on the mount, and there is no inode
exhaustion. This issue has happened before due to a known large log file that was not being
rotated. The administrator remembers the file name but cannot remember the location of the log
file or which process is writing to it.
Which of the following would be the BEST solution to correct this issue while maintaining
availability?
A. Use the lsof command to find where the large log file is located and truncate it
B. Use the locate command to find where the large log file is located and delete it
C. Use the du command to find where the large log file is located and delete it
D. Use the ps command to find which process is writing to the log file, and then kill and restart the
process
